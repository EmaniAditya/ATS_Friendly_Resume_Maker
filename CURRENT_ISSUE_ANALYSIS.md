# ATS Resume Maker: Preview/PDF Mismatch Issue Analysis

## Issue Summary
**Critical Bug**: PDF output does not match live preview content, resulting in incomplete/missing data in the downloaded PDF despite correct data being displayed in the live preview.

## Current State

### ✅ Live Preview (Correct)
Shows complete sample data including:
- Header: Full name, job title, contact info, location, DOB
- Summary: Complete professional summary
- Experience: Company names, job titles, dates, locations, descriptions
- Projects: All 3 projects with names, technologies, descriptions
- Skills: Rated skills with ratings + technical/soft skills
- Education: Institution names, degrees, dates, locations, GPA/percentage
- Certifications: Names, organizations, dates, credential IDs
- Achievements: Titles, dates, descriptions
- Languages: Names and proficiency levels

### ❌ PDF Output (Incomplete)
Missing or incomplete data:
- Header: Missing job title in some cases
- Experience: Shows only bullet point descriptions, missing company names, titles, dates
- Projects: Section appears empty or with minimal data
- Certifications: Missing organization details and credential IDs
- Achievements: Missing entirely or incomplete
- Skills: Missing rated skills section

## Technical Investigation Status

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Sample Data Loading** ✅ WORKING
   - SAMPLE_RESUME_DATA loads correctly
   - populateFormData() populates all form fields correctly
   - Form fields contain all expected data

2. **Live Preview Generation** ✅ WORKING  
   - generateResume() function renders all sections correctly
   - Uses data from populated form fields
   - All sections display complete information

3. **Data Collection for PDF** ✅ WORKING (Confirmed via debugging)
   - collectFormData() successfully extracts all data from form fields
   - Debug logs confirm:
     - Experience: `{company: Accenture, title: Packaged App Development Associate, startDate: 05/2025, endDate: 07/2025, description: ...}`
     - Projects: `{name: API Workflow Prototype, description: ..., technologies: ...}`
     - All sections collect complete data

4. **PDF Generation** ❌ ISSUE HERE
   - generateTextPDF() function receives correct data but produces incomplete output
   - **ROOT CAUSE LOCATION**: The issue is in PDF rendering logic, not data collection

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The problem is NOT in:
- Sample data structure
- Form field population  
- Data collection (collectFormData)

The problem IS in:
- PDF rendering logic (generateTextPDF function)
- Section rendering logic within PDF generation
- Data processing within PDF generation workflow

## Next Steps for Resolution
1. Trace through generateTextPDF() function execution
2. Identify why collected data is not being rendered properly in PDF
3. Compare PDF rendering logic with live preview rendering logic
4. Fix discrepancies to ensure 1:1 match between preview and PDF

## Expected Outcome
After fix: PDF output should be identical to live preview content with no missing sections or data.
